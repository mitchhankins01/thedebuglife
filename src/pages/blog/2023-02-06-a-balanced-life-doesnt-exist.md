## The Unattainable Ideal

A life where everything, such as work, relationships, and health, is perfectly balanced is an unattainable ideal. Trying to perfectly balance your life can actually hinder the progress of significant goals because achieving them necessitates a focus on a specific area at the expense of others, albeit for an appropriate amount of time. 

Some areas of life will inevitably be neglected even in the pursuit of balance. In reality, balance is not a static state but rather a dynamic process that requires constant adjustment and iteration.

The expectation of a balanced life is in many ways similar to the illusion of multitasking because it isn't possible to give equal attention and effort to all aspects of life at all times. Achieving a sense of balance comes from prioritizing and managing time effectively, rather than trying to do everything at once.

## History Of Work-Life Balance

The pursuit of a balanced life is a relatively recent phenomenon. Historically, work and life were inextricably linked, people dedicated most of their time to hunting or farming in order to sustain themselves. However, with the rise of the industrial revolution, people began working for others and lost control over their own time. 

The concept of work-life balance emerged in the 1980s as more women entered the workforce and had to balance work and family. This trend also extended to men, and with the rise of technology that blurs the lines between work and free time, the desire for balance has only grown larger.

One quite recent development that has blurred the lines between work and free time is the shift to remote work. While the benefits are many, such as reduced commute times and being able to attend to personal matters during work hours, remote work can also cause vague boundaries and make you feel even more out of of balance.

## Counterbalancing

The problem with trying to balance all areas of life is that it can often impede your ability to commit fully to one thing, yet you achieve results through exceptional effort. Instead of trying to do everything simultaneously or swinging between extremes, you should try to counterbalance. Focus on one thing at a time, and shift to another area only when you need to. 

Don't be too concerned about allowing certain areas of your life to be out of balance while you focus on the most important thing. Instead, decide if they should be out of balance for an extended or a short period. 

At work, go for a longer period by dedicating a significant amount of time to focus on one specific task in order to get those exceptional results. This may mean temporarily deprioritizing some responsibilities while occasionally shifting focus to address the most pressing issues.

In your personal life, you should only stay out of balance for shorter periods. Neglecting your family, friends, or personal interests may cause lasting harm. It's important to be aware of the needs of your loved ones and constantly counterbalance or switch your focus between personal priorities to address them. 

To effectively accomplish both your work and personal responsibilities, it's important to prioritize both areas rather than trying to balance them against each other. At work, focus on identifying and completing your top priority, allowing you to then focus on the priorities outside of work. Similarly, in your personal life, be clear about your priorities and address them so that you can return to work with a clear mind.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the pursuit of a perfectly balanced life is an unattainable ideal. Trying to balance all areas of life will hinder progress on your most important goals and lead to neglect in one area or the other. Counterbalancing allows you to focus on one thing at a time and achieve exceptional results at work while still being attentive to your personal life.

### Six Habits for Conquering Mental Health

I used to feel like the empty shell of a person just going through the motions of life. People jokingly referred to me as a robot and described me as overly logical without any apparent emotions. I was depressed, anxious, and didn't understand the point of being alive. 

I learned the importance of analyzing my needs and wants, consuming information and resources that got me excited about life, doing what needed to be done to close the gap with where I wanted to be, and finding rest within myself to be free from anxiety and disturbances. I also learned how to trust myself and to rely on a solid group of friends allowing me to tap into an enormous amount of strength.

I summarized everything I learned in the **Six Habits for Conquering Anxiety and Depression** e-book to help you make the same journey. You can sign up for my newsletter on the bottom of this page to receive blog updates (never spam), and you will receive the ebook *for free*.
