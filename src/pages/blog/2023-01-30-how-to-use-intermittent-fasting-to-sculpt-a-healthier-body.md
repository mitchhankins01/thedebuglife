title: How To Use Intermittent Fasting to Sculpt a Healthier Body
date: 2023-01-30T17:49:41.469Z
description: Intermittent fasting is a diet that focuses on when, rather than
  what, you eat. Followers of this diet eat only during a specific time period
  or just one meal a few days a week. Fasting can help your body burn fat more
  effectively and has been shown to have several potential health benefits.

Our bodies evolved to go without food for long periods; humans in prehistoric times had to hunt and gather food and survive without eating for extended periods of time. In today's world, it's challenging to maintain a healthy weight due to the availability of food and entertainment around the clock, as well as less physical activity. This can increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and various other health issues. Research has shown that intermittent fasting may be able to help reverse these trends.

## How Intermittent Fasting Works

Metabolic switching refers to the fact that the body can switch between different metabolic states or pathways in response to changes in nutrient availability. There are several pathways the body can use to produce energy, including the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

During periods of fasting, the body's energy needs must be met from stored energy sources, such as glycogen (a type of carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscles) and body fat. This can lead to a shift in the body's metabolic pathways and the primary source of energy. During periods of fasting, the body may switch to using fats as its primary energy source, leading to an increase in the breakdown of fat for energy.

## Benefits of Intermittent Fasting

Several biological mechanisms may contribute to the effects of intermittent fasting on various aspects of health. Some of these mechanisms include:

1. Increased insulin sensitivity: Intermittent fasting has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, which can help to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing diabetes. This may be due to the reduced availability of nutrients during periods of fasting, which can lead to an increase in insulin sensitivity.
2. Increased production of human growth hormone (HGH): Intermittent fasting has been shown to increase the production of HGH, a hormone that plays a role in muscle growth and fat metabolism.
3. Increased cellular stress resistance: Intermittent fasting has been shown to increase the production of certain proteins that protect cells from damage, known as heat shock proteins. This may help to improve cellular stress resistance and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.
4. Reduced inflammation: Intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body by reducing oxidative stress in cells, which may be beneficial for various health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
5. Autophagy: Intermittent fasting may stimulate autophagy, the body's natural process of eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells. This may help to improve cellular health and reduce the risk of disease.

It's important to note that more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of intermittent fasting fully and to determine the best ways to use it as a dietary strategy. It's also important to note that intermittent fasting is not suitable for everyone, and it's important to talk to a healthcare professional before starting any new diet or exercise regimen.

## Drawbacks of Intermittent Fasting

While there are benefits to intermittent fasting, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider.

If done improperly, intermittent fasting may lead to an imbalance in nutrient intake and an increased risk of nutrient deficiencies. When calorie intake is significantly reduced during periods of fasting, it may be challenging to consume enough essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals.

It's important to remember that the ratio between calorie intake and calorie expenditure ultimately determines weight gain or loss. If you consume more calories than you are burning, you will likely gain weight, regardless of whether you are practicing intermittent fasting. It's also important to pay attention to portion sizes and be mindful of the type and amount of food you consume.

When you're new to intermittent fasting, one of the first things you'll notice, besides the hunger, is the ups and downs in your mood. Fasting leads to low blood sugar levels, which in turn may cause irritability, anxiety, headaches, and fatigue. 

Intermittent fasting may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain medical conditions, medications, or eating disorders. If you have any concerns, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional before starting a new diet or exercise regimen.

While some evidence suggests that intermittent fasting may have a range of health benefits, more research is needed to fully understand the effects and determine the best ways to use it as a dietary strategy.

## Intermittent Fasting Plans

Here are some general guidelines for incorporating intermittent fasting into your diet:

1. Start slowly by gradually increasing the duration of your fasting periods to let your body adjust to a new eating pattern.
2. Stay hydrated by drinking a gallon of water daily, especially when fasting.
3. Eat a balanced diet consisting of various nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
4. Avoid overeating during non-fasting periods.
5. If you experience adverse side effects, such as extreme hunger or fatigue, it may be necessary to adjust your fasting routine or seek the advice of a healthcare professional.

Several different types of intermittent fasting plans involve restricting food intake for a set period each day or week. Some common types of intermittent fasting include:

1.  Time-restricted eating calls for limiting your food intake to specific periods of time each day, such as the 16/8 method, where you eat for eight hours and fast for the remaining 16 hours.
2. The 5:2 diet involves eating as you normally would for five days a week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories on the two remaining days.
3. Alternate-day fasting has you fasting every other day (500-600 calories) but eating normally on non-fasting days.
4. The Eat-Stop-Eat method involves abstaining from food for an entire 24-hour period once or twice a week.

### Six Habits for Conquering Anxiety and Depression

I used to feel like the empty shell of a person just going through the motions of life. People jokingly referred to me as a robot and described me as overly logical without any apparent emotions. I was depressed, anxious, and didn't understand the point of being alive. 

I learned the importance of analyzing my needs and wants, consuming information and resources that got me excited about life, doing what needed to be done to close the gap with where I wanted to be, and finding rest within myself to be free from anxiety and disturbances. I also learned how to trust myself and to rely on a solid group of friends allowing me to tap into an enormous amount of strength.

I summarized everything I learned in the **Six Habits for Conquering Anxiety and Depression** e-book to help you make the same journey. You can sign up for my newsletter on the bottom of this page to receive blog updates (never spam), and you will receive the ebook *for free*.
