##### Not living up to your potential

Do you ever feel like you're not quite living up to your potential? Do you feel like you're holding yourself back in some way? If so, I want to encourage you to invest in relationships with people that bring out the best in you. It can be difficult to be ourselves around others, but it's worth it. In this blog post, we will discuss how to invest in relationships that help us become the best versions of ourselves.
