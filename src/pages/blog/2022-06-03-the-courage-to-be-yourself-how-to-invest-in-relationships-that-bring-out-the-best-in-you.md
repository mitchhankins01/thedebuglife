##### Not living up to your potential

Do you ever feel like you're not quite living up to your potential? Do you feel like you're holding yourself back in some way? If so, I want to encourage you to invest in relationships with people that bring out the best in you. It can be difficult to be ourselves around others, but it's worth it. In this blog post, we will discuss how to invest in relationships that help us become the best versions of ourselves.

##### Becoming your best

Becoming the best version of yourself is very important when it comes to happiness in life. After all, if you're not happy with who you are, it's very difficult to be happy with anything else. There are many things that contribute to our happiness, but one of the most important is relationships. The people we surround ourselves with play a big role in how we see ourselves and how we feel about ourselves.

##### We all want to feel better

If you want to feel better about yourself there are some simple things you can do, but keep in mind simple does not equal easy. It takes courage to be yourself, especially if you have been hiding who you are for a long time. But it's so worth it to invest in relationships with people that bring out the best in you. These relationships will help motivate you and inspire you to become the best version of yourself. Thanks for reading! I hope this has inspired you to be more of who you already are.

The first thing you can do is find what brings you joy naturally and engage with people that enjoy the same things. When you are around people that make you happy, it will show in your attitude and interactions with others. It is also important to be honest about yourself and what you want out of relationships. This way, you can attract the right kind of people into your life. Finally, don't be afraid to let go of relationships that no longer serve you.

##### Meaning comes from joy

The things that bring you joy are those that come effortlessly to you. When you are in your element, you shine brightly and people are naturally drawn to you. It feels good to be around people that enjoy the same things as you and makes it easy to connect with them. When you are being honest about who you are, it shows in your body language and the way you carry yourself.

We aren't born with confidence, it is built one step at a time by knowing you who are and acting accordingly. It is a process that begins with accepting yourself for who you are and then sharing that authentic self with the world. When you know your truth, it becomes easier to stand up for what you believe in and defend your boundaries.
